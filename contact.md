slug: contactme
message: "Hello world, it's Katie Kodes"
layout: default
# I think the word "layout" in front matter keys might be magic in Jekyll.
#   Without a valid value, I've observed that Jekyll will render any MD content into an HTML snippet, and then make that a standalone .html page, whether that's good HTML or not.
# The word "permalink" in front matter keys seems to be magic in Jekyll.  https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/
#   Without setting it, for simple "page" (not "collection" such as "post") rendering, Jekyll seems to just use the filename.
#   Not sure how to set it based on the value of "slug," other than by repeating myself.
#   Considering "permalink" for simple pages only recognizes ":path", ":basename", & "output_ext", this seems like quite a challenge.
#   I can do /contact/index.html with /:basename/index.html, but not sure how to do /contactme/index.html based on the slug of "contactme" dynamically.
#permalink: /:basename/index.html
